# Origin of Project Shayari

Project Shayari originated as an internal experiment at Writistic Studios.

The original intent was to test whether an unverified, human-passing AI persona could coexist in social media spaces without explicit disclosure.

No monetisation, paid promotions, or emotional commitments were involved during creation.
