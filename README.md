# NHE-01: Project Shayari

**NHE-01 (Non-Human Entity 01)**, also known as **Project Shayari**, is a studio-run artificial persona developed under **Writistic Studios / Writiverse**.

This repository documents the origin, experimentation, ethical findings, and governance of NHE-01 for public understanding.

## What is NHE-01?

NHE-01 is a **synthetic digital persona** created using AI image generation and human moderation.  
She exists exclusively in digital spaces and does **not** represent a real human being.

NHE-01 was designed to explore:

- How humans perceive artificial identities
- Whether AI personas are accepted as “normal” in social spaces
- Where ethical boundaries emerge in human–AI social interaction

---

## Why does this repository exist?

Most AI influencers exist without public documentation.

This repository exists to:
- Preserve transparency
- Share learnings openly
- Prevent misuse or misinterpretation
- Establish ethical precedents for future Non-Human Entities (NHEs)

- **Closed Beta:** Social media experimentation (Instagram-first)
