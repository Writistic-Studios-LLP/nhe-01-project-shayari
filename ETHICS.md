# Ethical Learnings

The experiment identified an ethical saturation point when:
- Users attempted social identity blending
- Emotional vulnerability was projected
- Verification pressure emerged (voice, calls)

At this point, continuing ambiguity would have caused harm.

Actions taken:
- Termination of Closed Beta
- Boundary enforcement
- Public disclosure
- Documentation
