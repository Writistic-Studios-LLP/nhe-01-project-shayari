## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document exists to **publicly disclose, govern, and clarify** how **NHE-01: Project Shayari** operates across social media platforms—specifically Instagram—while upholding **privacy, ethical transparency, and user safety** in alignment with Writistic Studios’ Public Privacy Policy for NHE Projects.

---

## 2. Closed Beta Data Deletion Statement

Shayari’s Instagram activity during the **Closed Beta Testing phase** (Early 2025 to **23 December 2025**) involved controlled experimentation to understand behavioral boundaries, ethical saturation, and persona alignment.

### ✅ Official Declaration

All Instagram-related datasets collected during this period:

* Have been **permanently deleted**
* Have been **irreversibly erased**
* Are **no longer stored, archived, cached, or recoverable**
* Exist **nowhere** within Writistic Studios’ databases or backups

This deletion was carried out as part of the **Public Privacy Policy of NHE Projects**, ensuring zero post-beta data retention.

## 3. Reset Booting Phase (Ethical Reinitialization)

Following the Closed Beta data purge, Shayari entered a **Reset Booting Phase** to ethically realign her digital persona.

### 🛠 Reset Booting Timeline

* **Start:** 24 December 2025
* **End:** 24 January 2026

### What Reset Booting Means

* No social media interaction data was used
* No new data was collected
* Only **pre-approved, ethically validated insights** from Closed Beta were **precisely implemented**
* These implementations were **conceptual**, not data-driven
* The goal was **persona stability**, not learning or adaptation

This phase ensured Shayari complies strictly with the ethical framework established for NHE-01.

## 4. Open Beta Launch

### 🚀 Official Open Beta Start Date

**25 January 2026**

From this date onward, Shayari officially operates under **Open Beta Governance Protocols**.

---

## 5. Open Beta Operational Model

### 5.1 Automation & API Usage

During Open Beta:

* All Instagram interactions are handled via **automation using official APIs**
* Shayari responds strictly within **predefined behavioral and ethical constraints**
* She does **not self-learn**, adapt, or evolve from interactions

### 5.2 Human-in-the-Loop Monitoring

Despite automation:

* Every system is **continuously monitored**
* A **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** feedback mechanism is always active
* Edge cases, misuse, or unexpected scenarios are handled manually
* Automation is **never left unsupervised**

## 6. Data Collection & Training Policy (Open Beta)

### ❌ What Is NOT Collected

During Open Beta:

* No Instagram messages
* No comments
* No replies
* No DMs
* No engagement metadata
* No conversational context

are collected, stored, reused, or analyzed by Writistic Studios.

### ✅ How Shayari Is Trained

* Shayari’s training data is **extrinsically created in-house**
* It is **not derived from real human interactions**
* It is **not sourced from social media**
* It is **not generated from user conversations**

Shayari **does not retain**, memorize, or reuse any social media interaction for future training, fine-tuning, or modeling.

She responds **only as instructed**, nothing more.

---

## 7. Privacy & End-to-End Interaction Assurance

People interacting with Shayari can do so **freely and safely**.

### What “End-to-End Encrypted Conversations” Means in This Context

* Conversations **cannot** be used for:

  * Training
  * Fine-tuning
  * Analytics
  * Behavioral modeling
  * Any internal or external purpose
* Conversations are **not repurposed**
* Conversations are **not retained**

Writistic Studios **derives zero value** from these interactions beyond real-time response delivery.

---

## 8. Governance & Safety Enforcement

### 👩‍💼 Women-Led Operations Governance

All of Shayari’s **meta-interactions, behavioral boundaries, and operational oversight** are governed by **Women at Ops** within Writistic Studios.

This governance layer ensures:

* Zero tolerance for misuse or abuse
* Immediate handling of harmful or inappropriate interactions
* Strong enforcement of safety, respect, and ethical conduct

Shayari will **not engage**, **entertain**, or **respond** to any form of misuse or abuse.

---

## 9. Final Assurance

Shayari is a **synthetic digital persona**, not a human, not a self-learning AI, and not a data-harvesting system.

Her presence on social media exists to:

* Express a narrative persona
* Engage creatively
* Operate transparently
* Respect user privacy absolutely

This document stands as a **public, immutable declaration** of that commitment.
